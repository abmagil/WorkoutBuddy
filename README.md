This was my first real web development project ever.  I was new to essentially every technology, but had studied some small amount of Python and Java.  Accordingly, I tried to do everything with the basic tools.  You see evidence of this in the javascript especially, which is littered with document.getElementBy*, as I only knew tangentially of jQuery and didn't want to use it.

Nevertheless, it was a good real-world chance to use some Python, specifically BeautifulSoup4 and regexen (that's the plural right?  Like oxen?.  I also experimented with PHP (I was young!) and Mozilla's Persona, back when its documentation was atrocious.

Thanks go to Kevin Regan for his help at all steps in development and planning.
