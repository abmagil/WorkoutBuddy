# Workout Buddy

_Workout Buddy_ was my first real web development project ever.  I was new to essentially every technology, but had studied some small amount of Python and Java.  Accordingly, I tried to do everything with the basic tools.  You see evidence of this in the javascript especially, which is littered with document.getElementBy*, as I only knew tangentially of jQuery and didn't want to use it.

Nevertheless, it was a good real-world chance to use some Python, specifically [BeautifulSoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and regexen (that's the plural right?  Like oxen?.  I also experimented with PHP (I was young!) and Mozilla's Persona, back when its documentation was atrocious.

There is still a lot I would like to do with _Workout Buddy_, for instance
* Better natural language processing techniques to understand the Crossfit feed better
* Geolocation-aware mobile site, which allows you to only pull workouts from the gym you are at (different gyms will call the same machine multiple things, have different configurations, etc. which conspires to add variance to lifts which should be equivalent)
* WAY better formatting.  Introduce a CSS framework, or at least jQuery UI so that it doesn't look like a myspace nightmare

These things fell by the wayside as I realized how backwards my code was.  I moved on to better and brighter projects, but _Workout Buddy_ is still here, a reminder of where I came from.
